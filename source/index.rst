The IAM.AMR Project Documentation
=================================
Welcome to the documentation for the IAM.AMR project, which seeks to use Integrated Assessment Modelling (IAM) to describe Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) along the farm-to-fork continuum.

**Please Note** the documentation is being moved to a new home at `docs.iam.amr.pub <https://docs.iam.amr.pub/en/latest/index.html`_. Sections will be removed here as they are added to the new destination.
