Model Standardization and Progress Reports
Progress Levels
-	Non-Functional
-	Data Extraction
-	The data for each factor is being extracted from the literature
-	Data Entry
-	The data for each factor is being entered into Analytica
-	Exposure
-	Exposure data, including prevalence of bacterial contamination and consumptions pattern, is being entered into Analytica
-	Functional, Non-Informative
-	The basic model is constructed, however the model is not yet organized, and the interface is not yet fully constructed
-	Functional, Informative
-	The basic model is constructed, and the interface should be usable. At this stage, all outputs should be explained with accompanying text. I.e. you should be able to explain the output in laymenâ€™s terms.
-	Standardization
-	The model is being standardized to comply with the design direction and nomenclature determined for the project (and included in the SOPs).
-	Evergreen
-	The model has been standardized. It is clear, and presentable. It is ready to be updated when more information becomes available.
