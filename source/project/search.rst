Summary of Search Strategy
--------------------------

Comprehensive literature search strings were developed and pretested in Medline to return records for both human and animal populations of (a) the frequency of antimicrobial use or resistance (results not presented) and (b) the factors potentially associated with antimicrobial use or resistance (results presented herein; Appendix 1). The characterization of associations was broad and was not limited to interpretations of statistical significance, but included non-significant, causal and correlative relationships, or possible spurious findings. The searches included multiple broad and specific search terms for antimicrobial susceptibility, antimicrobial use, and population (animal or human), and specific search terms for Campylobacter species, E. coli, and S. enterica, and searches were not limited to a particular study design (e.g., observational, experimental, field trials, mathematical models). Following the pre-test, Medline and three other databases were searched as follows: Agricola, Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, using database‐specific search strings adapted from the initial pretested Medline search string. The initial search was conducted in May 2015 and was updated in June 2016.
