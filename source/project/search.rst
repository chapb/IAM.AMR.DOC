=================

For a complete overview of the search strategy and a qualitative description of the captured literature, please see *Murphy CP, Carson C, Smith BA, et al. Factors potentially linked with the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in selected bacteria from cattle, chickens and pigs: A scoping review of publications for use in modelling of antimicrobial resistance (IAM.AMR Project).

Summary of Search Strategy
--------------------------

Comprehensive literature search strings were developed and pretested in Medline to return records for both human and animal populations of (a) the frequency of antimicrobial use or resistance (results not presented) and (b) the factors potentially associated with antimicrobial use or resistance (results presented herein; Appendix 1). The characterization of associations was broad and was not limited to interpretations of statistical significance, but included non-significant, causal and correlative relationships, or possible spurious findings. The searches included multiple broad and specific search terms for antimicrobial susceptibility, antimicrobial use, and population (animal or human), and specific search terms for Campylobacter species, E. coli, and S. enterica, and searches were not limited to a particular study design (e.g., observational, experimental, field trials, mathematical models). Following the pre-test, Medline and three other databases were searched as follows: Agricola, Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, using database‐specific search strings adapted from the initial pretested Medline search string. The initial search was conducted in May 2015 and was updated in June 2016.

Title-abstract Screening using Rayyan
-------------------------------------
We chose `Rayyan <https://rayyan.qcri.org/welcome>`_ -- a free, online screening tool -- to complete title-abstract screening, because it offered the best combination of data managment and collaboration features on a free platform [#Ouzzani]_. 

Other screening tools considered included: `abstrackr <http://abstrackr.cebm.brown.edu/>`_, `Covidence <https://www.covidence.org/>`_, and `DistillerSR <https://www.evidencepartners.com/>`_. The former was rejected because of difficulties importing bibliographic information from RefWorks, while the latter were rejected due to cost-prohibitive pricing structures.

Work in Rayyan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Interface
+++++++++
There are three main sections of the Rayyan interface: filters, references, and preview.

.. figure:: /images/rayyan_basic_interface.png
    :align: center

    The Rayyan interface is comprised of three sections: filters, references, and preview.

Rayyan works like an email client; references are selected in the references panel, and are reviewed and acted upon in the preview panel. The filters panel allows for the selection of specific subsets of references, including by year, decision, keywords, etc.

Inclusion/exclusion decisions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
There are three possible inclusion/exclusion decisions: include, maybe, and exclude. Additionally, references can be tagged with 'reasons' and 'labels'.

'Reasons' are only applicable to excluded references (i.e. they are reasons for exclusion). While you do not have to specify a reason to mark a reference excluded, selecting a reason from the reason drop-down  automatically marks the reference as excluded. 'Labels' are applicable to all studies, and are used to identify specific references for follow-up.

.. caution:: Reasons and labels are not synchronized between reviewers. Care should be taken to ensure each reviewer creates the same reasons and labels.

The figure below shows five references, each in a different state of inclusion/exclusion. The first two references are marked as included -- the second also has an example label. The third and forth references are marked as excluded -- the fourth also has an exclusion reason. The fifth is marked as maybe.

.. tip:: To view larger versions of images on this website, right-click on the image and select 'open in new tab' or 'open in new window'.

To add a reason or label, simply type it in appropriate text-entry box. If you have used the reason or label before, it will autocomplete the entry. There are several default reasons included in the list.

.. tip:: The reasons and labels are sorted alphabetically. To make custom reasons or labels more easily accessible, prefix them with a number.

Using the keywords highlighting feature
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
During screening, it may become apparent that the presence or absence of certain key words predicts reference inclusion or exclusion -- or vice-versa. 

For example, an abstract containing the word 'murine' is very likely to refer to a study conducted in mice. If your review is focused on outcomes in humans, this reference is likely to be irrelevant, and be rejected.

.. caution:: Keywords are simply correlated with reference inclusion or exclusion -- you must still review the contents of the abstract in full to make a decision.

Rayyan includes a keywords highlighting feature which allows you to automatically highlight inclusion-related keywords in green, and exclusion-related keywords in red. This highlighting feature is enabled by default, and prepopulated with lists of automatically generated keywords. You will likely have to heavily-curate these lists; by default, Rayyan assumes you are conducting a systematic review of clinical trials, and bases the keywords on this assumption.

.. tip:: To disable this feature, simply toggle the large green ‘Highlights’ button in the preview panel.

You can customize your keywords in the filter panel. Delete the existing keywords from the ‘Keywords for include’ and ‘Keywords for exclude’ lists using the garbage can icon beside each term. To add new keywords, use the ‘Add new’ link in the lists’ titles. Note that the keywords must match exactly -- you may need to add singular and plural versions of each keyword.

Selecting references for review
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Unlike other literature review software, Rayyan will not automatically assign references to each partcipant -- it is up to each partcipant to select their own references.

Each reference must be reviewed in duplicate (i.e. by two reviewers). To ensure you're not reviewing a reference which has already been reviewed in duplicate, use the 'Maximum collaborator decisions' filter in the filters panel to limit the references to 'At most 1', as shown below.

.. figure:: /images/rayyan_filter_to_screen.png
    :align: center
    
    Using the 'At most 1' filter limits the returned references to those not already screened in duplicate.

Beyond that, reference selection is up to the partcipant. We suggest simply reviewing the studies in order, or using other filters to focus on references of personal interest.


Sign up for a Rayyan account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create an account at Rayyan on the `sign up page <https://rayyan.qcri.org/users/sign_up>`_. When creating an account, Rayyan will prompt you to enter your name, e-mail address, and affiliation. You will be sent a verification link to confirm your email address, and to allow you to create a password. Once you have created an account, please provide the primary reviewer the email address used during account creation.

.. note:: The affiliation provided is for Rayyan's interest -- it need not be the same between collaborators.

Select a review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Upon initial sign in, you will not have access to any reviews. After you provide your email address to the primary reviewer, you will be given access to two reviews (available from the Collaboration Reviews tab): amr-livestock and amr-livestock-pretest. The pretest must be completed first.

Review goals and inclusion criteria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The goal of this review is to identify any factors (any exposure or intervention) that affect the occurence of resistance in our list of food-animal commodities and bacterial species. Determining whether a study is conducted in the populations of interest is the easy part -- determining whether that study assesses the effect of a factor is more difficult. You will have to read the title and abstracts closely to determine whether the studies include a comparison between groups (i.e. assessing the effect of a factor), or simply establish prevalence of resistance. We developed a simple flow chart for the screening process.

    The screening process.

The populations of interest are included in the above flow chart. Additionally, consult this list of terms which are associated with food-animal species for reference.

Complete the pretest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The pretest consists of 50 articles, and is designed to highlight any problems with the review protocol or software.

Please screen all of the articles in the pretest.

Set and use exclusion reasons
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
During the pretest, we will use exclusion reasons to make it clear why references were excluded. Please use the following reasons, entering them as required:
 
 - '01. Wrong Commodity'
 - '02. Wrong Bacterial Species'
 - '03. No Factor Assayed'

Note that if more than one exclusion criterion applies, use the first criterion. For example, if a reference refers to a study of Brucellosis in sheep, the reference is rejected for '01. Wrong Commodity', though '02. Wrong Bacterial Species' likewise applies.

(Optional) Set and use keywords
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Some recommended keywords are provided below.

Include:

 - Food-animal commodity names (e.g. broilers, chicken, cattle, swine, pork, beef, steak)
 - Food-animal commodity adjectives (e.g. avian, bovine, porcine)
 - Bacterial genus names (e.g. E. coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Enterococcus)
 - Indications of a factor/comparison (e.g. factor, factors, comparison, effect)

Exclude:

 - Unrelated food-animal commodity names or indications of human populations (e.g. dog, fish, aquaculture, public health, hospitalization)
 - Unrelated bacterial genus names (e.g. Staphylococcus, Klebsiella)
 - Indications of no factor/comparison (e.g. prevalence, surveillance)
