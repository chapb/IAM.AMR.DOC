About this Documentation
========================
This documentation is written in `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ (reST), a lightweight markup language originally used for documenting Python (the computer programming language). Like other markup languages (e.g. Markdown, AsciiDoc), reST combines plain-text, human-readable content with simple formatting tags to outline a universal document structure. 

What does that actually mean? All of our content is written in plain text, like the files you open in Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (MacOS). The plain-text files are converted to the appropriate language (e.g. HTML for a website, PDF, EPUB) by a document generator -- Sphinx. Basically, Sphinx takes a file that looks like this::

And turns it into this site or document!

The raw files are stored in GitHub, a web-based service for version control and collaboration. As files are submitted or changed, `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ runs an instance of Sphinx, generates the HTML, and hosts it here! Read the Docs is a free hosting service for documentation, supported by `unobtrusive and ethical ads <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advertising/ethical-advertising.html>`_.

How do I view larger versions of images on this website?
--------------------------------------------------------
To view larger versions of images and on this website, right-click on the image and select 'open in new tab' or 'open in new window'.

How do I make edits?
--------------------
If you’re familiar with GitHub and aren’t afraid to learn a little reST (it’s simple -- we swear) fork the `IAM.AMR.DOC repo <https://github.com/chapb/IAM.AMR.DOC>`_ and submit a pull request.

If you have minor edits, and GitHub or reST aren’t your thing, submit the requested changes directly to Brennan Chapman.

Where can I find more information?
