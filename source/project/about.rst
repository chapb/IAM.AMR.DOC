About this document
===================
This documentation is written in reStructuredText (reST), a lightweight markup language originally used for documenting Python (the computer programming language). Like other markup languages (e.g. Markdown, AsciiDoc), reST combines plain-text, human-readable content with simple formatting tags to outline a universal document structure. Then, the raw plain-text files are converted to the appropriate language (e.g. HTML for a website, PDF, EPUB) by a document generator -- Sphinx.

The raw files are stored in GitHub, a web-based service for version control and collaboration. As files are submitted or changed, `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ runs an instance of Sphinx, generates the HTML, and hosts it here!

How do I make edits?
--------------------
If you’re familiar with GitHub and aren’t afraid to learn a little reST (it’s simple -- we swear) fork the `IAM.AMR.DOC repo <https://github.com/chapb/IAM.AMR.DOC>`_ and submit a pull request.

If you have minor edits, and GitHub or reST aren’t your thing, submit the requested changes directly to Brennan Chapman.

Where can I find more information?
----------------------------------
