Style Guide
-----------
Appending a suffix on 'model' requires the insertion of a second 'l':
   e.g. 'modeller'; 'modelling'

The following are always hyphenated:
   * model-builder
   * end-user
   * farm-to-fork

The following are always capitalized:
   * Intelligent Array

The proper name of functions and objects are always capitalized where refering to a generic function or object: 
   e.g. 'Choice function'; 'Table()'; 'Uniform function'

The names of specific objects should always be capitalized and italicized. The type of object is not capitalized or italicized:
   e.g. 'the *Interface* index'; 'the *Frequency* node'

Key Words
---------
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in `RFC 2119 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>`_:

MUST
   This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.
MUST NOT   
   This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT", mean that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.
SHOULD
   This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
SHOULD NOT   
   This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label.
MAY
   This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is truly optional. An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the same vein an implementation which does include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the option provides).

Attributes
----------

Model Name
~~~~~~~~~~
The models are named **IAM.AMR.XZY** where **XYZ** represents a three character short-code identifying the model. The code should be relevant to the contents of the model.

   Ex. The IAM.AMR.CHI model focuses on chickens, while the IAM.AMR.3GC focuses on third-generation cephalosporins.

Factor Identifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The factor identifier is automatically generated by the cedarr package, in the format **A####_Name_of_Factor** where:

* **A** is either 'R' for a standard factor, or 'M' for a meta-analysis
* **####** is the factor or meta-analysis number

Where multiple factors inform a single node:

* and one or more of the factors is a meta-analysis, use the meta-analysis identifier with the lowest number
* and all of the factors are not meta-analyses, use the identifier with the lowest number
* and all of the factors are meta-analyses, use the identifier with the lowest number

In some instances, it may be appropriate to deviate from this schema â€“ care should be taken to maintain consistency despite these deviations.

Node Colour
~~~~~~~~~~~
Colour is used to indicate the function and contents of each node. The use of colour in the model should conform to the general scheme:

Light Grey
   Non user-modifiable node that performs intermediate calculations, or which is otherwise exposed to the user via a separate user interface
Dark Grey
   A node containing a list of factors
Orange
   An objective node, containing intermediate or final results of calculations
Purple
   A user interface node
Blue
   A factor node, or a node which contains epidemiological data

Note, the following colour designations are liable to change, as the models are further standardized:

Pink
   A node in which the factor is informed by meta-analysis
Peach
   A node which contains information for multiple bacterial species
Gold
   A node which contains information for multiple bacterial species, informed by meta-analyses
