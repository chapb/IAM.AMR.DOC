Style Guide
-----------
Appending a suffix on 'model' requires the insertion of a second 'l':
   e.g. 'modeller'; 'modelling'

The following are always hyphenated:
   * model-builder
   * end-user
   * farm-to-fork

The following are always capitalized:
   * Intelligent Array

The proper name of functions and objects are always capitalized where refering to a generic function or object: 
   e.g. 'Choice function'; 'Table()'; 'Uniform function'

The names of specific objects should always be capitalized and italicized. The type of object is not capitalized or italicized:
   e.g. 'the *Interface* index'; 'the *Frequency* node'

Key Words
---------
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in `RFC 2119 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>`_:

MUST
   This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.
MUST NOT   
   This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT", mean that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.
SHOULD
   This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
SHOULD NOT   
   This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label.
MAY
   This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is truly optional. An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the same vein an implementation which does include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the option provides).
