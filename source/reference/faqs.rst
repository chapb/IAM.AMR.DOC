What are some of the epidemiological or statistical concerns with respect to our approach?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The largest statistical and epidemiological concern is the application of data from foreign populations in the Canadian context. From a purely epidemiological perspective, we must question whether the production practices in foreign countries are similar enough to Canadian practices as to draw valid conclusions. From a statistical perspective, we derive odds ratios from foreign populations with different baseline levels of resistance. Therefore, the effect of a given factor may be over or under estimated when applied in our models.

A secondary concern is that factors may not truly be reciprocal. If we propose a given level of antimicrobial use is related to the development of a given level of resistance, does removing that use from an existing system cause an equal, but opposite drop in resistance? Likely not â€“ but interwoven are so many confounding factors that we may never know, and must instead assume. 

A tertiary concern is that factors are not truly independent, although for practical reasons, we assume them to be. Unfortunately, where we may have as many as 20 factors in the model, creating a dependency between even half would require a prohibitive amount of data. We do recognize this point, especially where factors are mutually exclusive (e.g. organic production and antimicrobial use), but leave it to the user to select the factors they wish to evaluate in the model.


What are our future goals?

Time, Quantitative AMU, Human side, Environment, WGS, Sensitivity.

Troubleshooting

Why can I not access the IAM.AMR model repository?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please ensure you have...

 1. Created a GitHub account and submitted your GitHub username to the :ref:`IAM.AMR Repository Administrator <reference/roles:Roles>`, either directly, or through the `onboarding survey and guide <https://uoguelph.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cBeTb8mUpkJPdvn>`_?
 2. Waited one to two days. Approval is manual -- it may take one to two days to complete.
 3. Accepted the invitation, either through an email notification, a notification on GitHub, or by visiting the `invitation page <https://github.com/chapb/IAM.AMR/invitations>`_ while signed in to your account.
    - If that page does not resolve (i.e. the page is not found), move on to another step.
 4. Attemped to access the repository, either directly, at https://github.com/chapb/IAM.AMR or in the repositories list on the left-hand side of GitHub while signed in to your account.

If you have tried the steps above, and you still can not access the IAM.AMR model repository, please contact the :ref:`IAM.AMR Repository Administrator <reference/roles:Roles>`.
